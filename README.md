# Photobox Full Stack JS test

This test is designed for potential full stack developers to demonstrate their coding skills. It's intended to be done in less than 90 minutes.

### Deliverable

Your task is to create part of a listing page. The data for the listing page can be accessed via `/api/products` (see. /api).

Please return at minimum a couple of components and some tests using `jest`. Feel free to import any modules that you feel you require or make any changes you deem necesary.

We're mainly interested in seeing how you approach this problem and how far you'll get. This is what it should look like:



## Main commands
``` bash
# Install the dependencies
yarn install

# Run website in dev (hot reload) mode ( http://localhost:3000 )
yarn dev

# Serve the production build ( http://localhost:3000 )
yarn prod
```

## Other useful commands
``` bash
# Run tests
yarn test

# Create a development build
yarn build:dev

# Create a production build
yarn build:prod

# Serve content from build folder
yarn serve
```
