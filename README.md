# Photobox Full Stack JS test

This test is designed for potential full stack developers to demonstrate their coding skills. It's intended to be done in XX-XX minutes.

### Deliverable

Your task is to create part of a listing page. The data for the listing page can be accessed via `/api/products` (see. /api).

Please return at minimum a couple of components and some tests using `Jest`. Feel free to import any modules that you feel you require or make any changes you deem necesary.

We're mainly interested in seeing how you approach this problem and how far you'll get - if we like your code there'll be another opportunity to extend/explain it in an on-site pairing exercise.
